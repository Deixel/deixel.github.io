Recently, I was going through a box of electronics and stumbled across my faithful companion, a Nexus 4. It was solid, reliable device, that was only surplanted by my even-more-faithful OnePlus One due to a lack of storage space.
Unless I can find a new backplate (the current one having shed most of it's clips and is hanging on by a spit and a prayer), my OPO is probably on it's last legs. 

The Nexus 4 though? Aside from some fingerprints and a bit of dust, it's practically brand new, albeit 5-odd years old at this point. After squirting some power into it, it booted into Android Lollipop (5.1). Not terrible, but 7 and 8 are common now and 9 is on the way, so it's a bit behind in features and security updates. Not a problem. I've been running [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org) on the OPO for a while now, and had only the occasional complaint about it, plus there are builds available for the Nexus 4. Perfect.

Going through the installation process, I noticed a note regarding the installation of Google Apps, and that got me thinking. I've been a bit of a Privacy kick lately, taking more care over what I share with these data-hungry online services, who hold my calendar, notes, contacts, music and, thanks to Google Play Services, most of my phone hostage.

This got me thinking. How dependant is Android on Google? Can I get away with avoiding Google, but still have a usable smartphone?

### Apps
Of course, the biggest point of a smartphone is apps. And, of course, the biggest app store on Android is the Google Play Store, which in turn requires Google Play Services, so that's that one out straight away.
